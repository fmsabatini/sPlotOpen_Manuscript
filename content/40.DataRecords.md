## Data Records {.page_break_before}

sPlotOpen contains 94,210 vegetation plots from 110 countries and all continents except Antarctica (Figure {@fig:Figure1}). 
This randomized selection comes from 104 constitutive datasets (Table @tbl:Table1). 
The number of plots selected in each of the three resampling iterations is 49,247, 49,255 and 49,255. Of these, 19,440 plots are shared across all the three iterations, while 14,667 plots are shared between two iterations.
sPlotOpen only contains the species composition of vascular plants; information on the composition of bryophytes and lichens was discarded since it was only available for a minority of plots (n = 11,001 and n = 6,801, respectively).
Information on the size (surface area) of the vegetation survey is available for 64,567 vegetation plots, and ranges between 0.03 and 40,000 m^2^ (mean = 376 m^2^; median = 100 m^2^). 
Similarly, only for a minority of plots (n = 23,273) information on the exact group of plants sampled in the field is available (e.g., complete vegetation, only trees, only trees > 1 m height, and so on). 
However, as most data were collected using the phytosociological method, we deem safe to assume that, unless otherwise specified, plots contain information on all vascular plants.
We retained plots with incomplete vegetation, because they were mostly located in the tropics, i.e., in areas where vegetation plots are particularly scarce otherwise.
The average number of vascular plant species per vegetation plot ranges between 1 (i.e. monospecific stands) and 271 species (mean = 20; median = 16).

By capping the number of vegetation plots in overrepresented environmental conditions, the resampling procedure described above strongly reduced the bias in the distribution of vegetation plots within the environmental niche space. 
Yet, due to the lack or scarcity of data from some geographical regions, like the tropics, the spatial distribution of vegetation plots remains unbalanced across geographical regions (Figure {@fig:Figure1}). 
This is evident when comparing the number of plots across continents or biomes. 
One considering the first resampling iteration, Europe is by far the best represented continent, with 15,920 vegetation plots. 
In contrast, in Africa and South America the remaining plots after data edition and selection were 3,176, and 5,498 vegetation plots, respectively. 
Compared to continents, the representation of biomes is better balanced. 
With the exception of the 'Temperate mid-latitudes' biome, which includes 14,100 vegetation plots, all other biomes have a number of plots comprised between 1,558 ('Polar and subpolar zone') and 6,245 ('Subtropics with year-round rain') vegetation plots (Figure {@fig:Figure2}, left). 
Despite these imbalances, all the Whittaker biomes are covered by sPlotOpen (Figure {@fig:Figure2}, right), and our resampling algorithm has resulted in a much more balanced dataset than many other large global datasets that are available, such as GBIF.

Left: plots are color coded based on sBiomes, i.e., sPlot definition of biomes (@doi:10.1111/jvs.12710), which derives from Schultz 2005 (@doi:10.1007/3-540-28527-x) ecozones, modified to include also the alpine biome from Körner et al. 2017 (@doi:10.1007/s00035-016-0182-6). Right: the same plots superimposed onto Whittaker (1975) biomes (@Whittaker1975), as adapted by Rickleff 2008 (@isbn:9780716786979) and plotted using the *R* package *plotbiomes*.](images/figure2.png){#fig:Figure2}

Almost one third of vegetation plots in sPlotOpen belong to forest (n = 37,399), one half to non-forest vegetation (n = 45,725) vegetation, with 12 % of plots remaining unassigned (n = 11,086). 
When not directly done by data providers, the assignment of plots to forests and non-forests was based on multiple lines of evidence, including the plot-level information on the cover of the tree layer, as well as traits of species composing a plot, such as growth form and height. 
In short, a plot record was considered as forest if the cover of the tree layer, or alternatively, the sum of the (relative) cover of all tree taxa (normalized to 100%), was greater than 25%. It was considered a non-forest record if the sum of relative cover of low‐stature, non‐tree and non‐shrub taxa was greater than 90%. 
For an extensive explanation of this classification scheme, we refer the reader to Bruelheide et al. (2019) \[@doi:10.1111/jvs.12710\]. 
Even if the proportion of forest vs. non-forest vegetation plots is relatively well-balanced, the geographical distribution of vegetation plots belonging to different vegetation types is likely not balanced in the geographical space, as it depends on the idiosyncrasies of the constitutive datasets composing the sPlot database. 
For instance, the data from New Zealand only include plots collected in non-forest ecosystems, while data from Chile only refer to forests. 
We urge potential users to carefully read the description of each individual dataset in [GIVD](http://www.givd.info), or to contact the custodians of each dataset before using sPlotOpen.
