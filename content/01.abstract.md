## Abstract {.page_break_before}


Plants provide a basic pillar of life on Earth. Vegetation as the co-occurrence of plants is habitat, indicator of site conditions as well as a strong variable in global material cycles.
Assessing status and trends in plant communities is also crucial to understand and quantify the effects of global change on ecosystems.
Here, we present the largest dataset of vegetation plots (i.e. species co-occurrence or community composition data) ever released in open access.
It contains information on 91,031 vegetation plots recording the cover or abundance of each plant species that occurs in a plot of a given surface area at the date of the survey.
Plots were derived from 103 local to regional datasets. To improve the representation of Earthâ€™s environmental conditions, plots were resampled from a larger pool of vegetation plots using an environmentally stratified sampling design.
Each vegetation plot comes with information on community-weighted means and variances of key plant functional traits.
Our open-access dataset can be used among others to explore global patterns of diversity at the plant community level, 
as ground truthing data in remote sensing applications or as a baseline for biodiversity monitoring.
