## Abstract {.page_break_before}


Assessing biodiversity status and trends in plant communities is critical for understanding, quantifying and predicting effects of global change on ecosystems. 
Vegetation plots record occurrence or abundance of all plant species present in a delimited area (community composition). Absences can be inferred, allowing analyses not possible with presence-only data. 
Recently the first global vegetation plot database was compiled (‘sPlot’). 
However, this large dataset is environmentally and spatially unbalanced, and not open-access. 
We address both issues by (a) resampling the vegetation plots using a novel algorithm; 
(b) securing permission to openly release data from the holders of 104 specific datasets. 
We present the largest open-access vegetation plot dataset ever released: 91,205 plots globally, recording abundance of each vascular plant species (total 39,997 taxa). 
Values for 18 traits are provided per species, and community-weighted mean and variance per plot. 
Plot-level data include location, date, size, biome, elevation, aspect, vegetation type and naturalness. 
The dataset can be used to explore plant community diversity patterns globally, as ground truthing data in remote sensing applications or as baselines for biodiversity monitoring.
