## Abstract {.page_break_before}


Assessing biodiversity status and trends in plant communities is critical for understanding, quantifying and predicting effects of global change on ecosystems. Vegetation plots record plant species occurrence or abundance (community composition) data – including both absences and presences, allowing analyses not possible with presence-only data. Recently the first global vegetation plot database was amassed (‘sPlot’). However, this large dataset is extremely unbalanced spatially, and not open-access. We address both issues by (a) resampling the vegetation plots using a novel algorithm; (b) securing permission from data holders to openly release data (from 104 specific datasets). We present the largest open-access vegetation plot dataset ever released: 91,205 plots globally, recording abundance of each vascular plant species (total 39,997 taxa). Values for 18 traits are provided per species, and community-weighted mean and variance per plot. Plot-level data include location, date, size, biome, elevation, aspect, vegetation type and naturalness. The dataset can be used to explore plant community diversity patterns globally, as ground truthing data in remote sensing applications or as baselines for biodiversity monitoring.
