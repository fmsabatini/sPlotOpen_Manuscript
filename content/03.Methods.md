## Methods {.page_break_before}

### Vegetation plot data sources
We started from the sPlot database v2.1 (created October 2016), which contains 1,121,244 vegetation plots and 23,586,216 species records stemming from 110 different vegetation‚Äêplot datasets of regional, national or continental extent. 
Some of the 110 datasets stem from regional or continental initiatives (see @doi:10.1111/jvs.12710 for more information). 
For instance: 48 vegetation-plot datasets derive from the European Vegetation Archive (EVA) (@doi:10.1111/avsc.12191); three major African datasets derive from the Tropical African Vegetation Archive (TAVA); and multiple vegetation datasets in the USA derive from the VegBank archive (@PeetLeeBoyle2012; @Peet2012). 
Data from other continents (South America, Asia) or countries were contributed as separate standalone datasets. 
The metadata of each individual vegetation-plot dataset stored in sPlot are managed through the Global Index of Vegetation‚ÄêPlot Databases [GIVD](http://www.givd.info) (@doi:10.1111/j.1654-1103.2011.01265.x), using the GIVD identifier as the unique dataset identifier.

### Resampling method
Data in the sPlot database are unevenly distributed across continents and biomes (see @doi:10.1038/s41559-018-0699-8). 
Mid-latitude regions in developed countries (mostly Europe, the USA and Australia) are overrepresented, while regions in the tropics and subtropics are underrepresented, which is a typical geographical bias in biodiversity data (e.g., @doi:10.1111/ecog.00967; @doi:10.1038/s41559-020-1198-2). 
To reduce this imbalance to the extent possible, we performed a stratified resampling approach, using several environmental variables available at global extent as sampling strata. 
We considered 30 climatic and soil variables. 
For climate, we complemented the 19 bioclimatic variables from CHELSA (@doi:10.1038/sdata.2017.122), as well as two variables reflecting growing-season warmth (growing degree days above 1 ¬∞C - GDD1 - and 5 ¬∞C - GDD5), which we calculated based on CHELSA bioclimatic variables. 
In addition, we considered an index of aridity (AR) and a model for Potential Evapotranspiration (PET - @https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7707605.v3). 
For soil, we extracted seven variables from the SOILGRIDS database (@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0169748), namely: soil organic carbon content in the fine earth fraction, cation exchange capacity, pH, as well as the fractions of coarse fragments, sand, silt and clay.  

We stratified our sampling effort based on the following procedure. 
First, we ran a global principal component analysis (PCA) of the 30 above-mentioned environmental variables. 
We considered the full environmental space of all terrestrial habitats on Earth at a spatial resolution of 2.5 arcmin, totaling 8,384,404 terrestrial grid cells, irrespective of whether a grid cell hosted vegetation plots from the sPlot database v2.1 or not. 
We then subdivided the environmental space represented by the first two principal components (PC1‚ÄìPC2), accounting for 47% and 23% of the total variation on PC1 and PC2, respectively, into a 100 √ó 100 grid. 
This PC1-PC2 bidimensional space was subsequently used to balance our sampling effort across all PC1-PC2 grid cells for which vegetation plots are available.
Before projecting vegetation plots from the sPlot database v2.1 onto this PC1-PC2 environmental space, we removed vegetation plots: from wetlands; from anthropogenic vegetation types; without geographical coordinates; and with a location uncertainty higher than 3 km for those having geographical coordinates. 
This led to a total of 799,400 out of the initial set of 1,121,244 vegetation plots. 
When projecting the 799,400 vegetation plots in the PC1-PC2 grid, we calculated how many vegetation plots occurred in each PC1-PC2 grid cell. 
For those grid cells with more than 50 vegetation plots (n = 858), we randomly selected up to 50 vegetation plots using the heterogeneity-constrained random resampling algorithm from Lengyel et al. (2011) \[@doi:10.1111/j.1654-1103.2010.01225.x\]. 
This approach optimizes the selection of a random subset of vegetation plots that encompasses the highest variability in species composition while avoiding peculiar and rare communities, which may represent outliers. 
We based the quantification of variability in plant species composition among the 50 randomly selected vegetation plots by computing the mean and the variance of the Jaccard‚Äôs dissimilarity index (@doi:10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00756.x) between all possible pairs of vegetation plots for a given random selection of 50 vegetation plots (n = 1225). 
More precisely, for a given PC1-PC2 grid cell containing more than 50 vegetation plots, we generated 1,000 random selections of 50 vegetation plots and ranked them according to the mean (ascending order) and variance (descending order) value. 
Ranks from both sortings were summed for each random selection, and the selection with the lowest summed rank was considered the most representative of the focal grid cell. 
In case a grid cell contained fewer than 50 plots, we retained all of them. 
In this way, we reduced the imbalance towards over-sampled climate types while ensuring that the resampled dataset represents the entire environmental gradient covered by the sPlot database.
We repeated the resampling procedure three times to get three different possibilities of a random selection of 50 vegetation plots per PC1-PC2 grid cell with, initially, more than 50 vegetation plots. 
Vegetation plots selected during the first iteration were our first choice, while we considered the vegetation plots additionally selected in the second and third iteration as reserves when asking for permission to release the data as open access to each dataset‚Äôs contributor(s).  

### Permission to release the data as open access
The resampling procedure resulted in a preliminary potential selection of 98,383 vegetation plots (first choice) and 51,634 vegetation plots flagged as reserves (second or third choice for the subset of PC1-PC2 grid cells with more than 50 vegetation plots available). 
Being, the sPlot database, a consortium of independent datasets, whose copyright belongs to the data contributor, we used this preliminary potential selection to ask each dataset‚Äôs custodian (i.e., either the owner of a dataset or its authorized representative in case of a collective dataset) for permission to release the data of each selected vegetation plot as open access. 
For 8,070 vegetation plots, permission could not be granted because, for instance, the data are unpublished, confidential or sensitive. 
For these vegetation plots, we used the reserve pool to randomly select replacements, for which such permission could be granted. 
We imposed the constraint that each vegetation plot in the reserve should belong to the same environmental stratum, i.e., the same PC1-PC2 grid cell, of the confidential vegetation plot. 
Note that 2,380 PC1-PC2 grid cells (11.7% of total) had one or more confidential vegetation plot (median = 1, mean = 3.4, max = 171) that could not be replaced from the reserve pool.

### Trait information
For each vegetation plot for which open access has been granted, we computed the community weighted means for eighteen plant functional traits derived from the TRY database v3.0 (@https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14904). 
These traits were selected among those traits that describe the leaf, wood and seed economics spectra (@https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1004327224729; @doi:10.1111/1365-2745.12211), and are known to either affect different key ecosystem processes or respond to macroclimatic drivers, or both (@doi:10.1111/jvs.12710). 
The eighteen plant functional traits were: (1) leaf area \[mm^2^\]; (2) stem specific density \[g cm^-3^\]; (3) specific leaf area \[m^2^kg^-1^\]; (4) leaf carbon concentration \[mg g^-1^\]; (5) leaf nitrogen concentration \[mg g^-1^\]; (6) leaf phosphorus concentration \[mg g^-1^\]; (7) plant height \[m\]; (8) seed mass \[mg\]; (9) seed length \[mm\]; (10) leaf dry matter content \[g g^-1^\]; (11) leaf nitrogen per area \[g m^-2^\]; (12) leaf N:P ratio \[g g^-1^\]; (13) leaf ùõø^15^N \[per million\]; (14) seed number per reproductive unit; (15) leaf fresh mass \[g\]; (16) stem conduit density \[mm^-2^\]; (17) dispersal unit length \[mm\]; and (18) conduit element length \[Œºm\].  

Because missing values were particularly widespread in the species-trait matrix, we employed a gap-filling procedure based on hierarchical Bayesian modeling (R package ‚ÄòBHPMF‚Äô, @doi:10.1109/ICMLA.2014.56; @doi:10.1111/geb.12335). 
Gap-filling was performed at the level of individual observations. 
We then transformed to the natural logarithm all gap‚Äêfilled trait values and averaged each trait by taxon (i.e., at species, or genus level). Additional information on the gap-filling procedure is available in \[@doi:10.1111/jvs.12710\].  

Community‚Äêweighted means (CWM) and variances (CWV)  were calculated for every plant functional trait j and every vegetation plot k as follows (@doi:10.1016/bs.aecr.2015.02.001):  
 
$$ CWM_{j,k} = \sum_{i}^{n_k} p_{i,k} t_{i,j}$$ {#eq:Equation1}  
$$ CWV_{j,k} = \sum_{i}^{n_k} p_{i,k} (t_{i,j} - CWM_{j,k})^2$$ {#eq:Equation2}  

where n~k~ is the number of species with trait information in vegetation plot k, p~i,k~ is the relative abundance of species i in vegetation plot k calculated as the species‚Äô fraction in cover or abundance of total cover or abundance, and t~i,j~ is the mean value of species i for trait j.
