## Abstract

**Motivation:** 
Assessing biodiversity status and trends in plant communities is critical for understanding, quantifying and predicting the effects of global change on ecosystems, among other applications. 
Vegetation plots record occurrence or abundance of all plant species present (community composition) in delimited local areas.
These data also allow inferring absences, enabling many analyses not possible using the presence-only data provided by existing global plant datasets. 
Although very many vegetation plots have been recorded, most are not available to the global research community. 
A recent initiative, sPlot, compiled the first global vegetation plot database, and continues to grow and curate it. 
However, this large dataset is challenging to work with because it is extremely unbalanced spatially, and because the data are not open-access. 
Here, we address both these issues by 
(a) resampling the vegetation plots using a novel algorithm and 
(b) securing permission from data holders to openly release data (from 105 local to regional datasets). 
We thus present sPlotOpen, the largest open-access dataset of vegetation plots ever released. 
sPlotOpen can be used to explore global patterns of diversity at the plant community level, as ground truthing data in remote sensing applications or as a baseline for biodiversity monitoring.

**Main types of variable contained:** 
91,205 vegetation plots, recording cover or abundance of naturally occurring vascular plant species in delimited areas.
Besides geographic location, date, plot size, biome, elevation, slope, aspect, vegetation type, naturalness, coverage of various vegetation layers and source dataset, plot-level data also include community-weighted mean and variance of 18 plant functional traits from the 'TRY' database.

**Spatial location and grain:** 
global, 0.01-40,000 mÂ².

**Time period and grain:** 
1888-2015, recording dates.

**Major taxa and level of measurement:** 
39,997 vascular plant taxa, plot-level records.

**Software format:** 
three main matrices (.csv), relationally linked.
