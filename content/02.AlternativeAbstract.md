## Short Running Title
sPlotOpen: a global vegetation plot database

## Abstract

**Motivation:** 
Assessing biodiversity status and trends in plant communities is critical for understanding, quantifying and predicting the effects of global change on ecosystems. 
Vegetation plots record the occurrence or abundance of all plant species co-occurring within delimited local areas. 
This allows species absences to be inferred, an information seldom provided by existing global plant datasets. 
Although many vegetation plots have been recorded, most are not available to the global research community. 
A recent initiative, called 'sPlot', compiled the first global vegetation plot database, and continues to grow and curate it. 
This large dataset, however, is challenging to work with because it is extremely unbalanced spatially, and because the data are not open-access. 
Here, we address both these issues by 
(a) resampling the vegetation plots using a novel algorithm and 
(b) securing permission from data holders of 105 local-to-regional datasets to openly release data. 
We thus present sPlotOpen, the largest open-access dataset of vegetation plots ever released. 
sPlotOpen can be used to explore global patterns of diversity at the plant community level, as ground truth data in remote sensing applications, or as a baseline for biodiversity monitoring.

**Main types of variable contained:** 
Vegetation plots (n = 95,104) recording cover or abundance of naturally occurring vascular plant species within delimited areas.
sPlotOpen contains three partially overlapping, environmentally balanced datasets (~50,000 plots each), to be used as replicates in global analyses.
Besides geographic location, date, plot size, biome, elevation, slope, aspect, vegetation type, naturalness, coverage of various vegetation layers and source dataset, plot-level data also include community-weighted means and variances of 18 plant functional traits from the 'TRY' database.

**Spatial location and grain:** 
Global, 0.01-40,000 mÂ².

**Time period and grain:** 
1888-2015, recording dates.

**Major taxa and level of measurement:** 
42,677 vascular plant taxa, plot-level records.

**Software format:** 
Three main matrices (.csv), relationally linked.
