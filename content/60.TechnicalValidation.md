## Technical Validation {.page_break_before}

The original sPlot database has a nested structure and consists of several individual datasets, each validated and maintained by its respective dataset custodian. 
In many cases, individual datasets are also collections whose vegetation plots were provided by their respective owners (the person who performed the actual vegetation survey) or by someone who digitized the original data from the scientific published or grey literature. 
We obviously have no direct control over the individual vegetation plots that we provide here in sPlotOpen. 
Yet, all these vegetation plots stem from trained professional botanists, or published scientific work, and are accompanied by detailed information on the sampling protocols used, thus ensuring data quality and reliability.  

Before integration into the sPlot database, each dataset was further checked for consistency and, if it was in a different format, we converted it to a Turboveg 2 dataset (@doi:10.2307/3237010). 
During this conversion, we checked that all datasets contained the required metadata information, and cross-checked that each plot was located within the geographic scopes of its respective dataset. 
All individual Turboveg 2 datasets were then integrated into a Turboveg 3 database, and exported to comma-separated files.
Finally, we harmonized all the taxonomic names from all datasets, based on the sPlot’s taxonomic backbone (@doi:10.5281/zenodo.845445). 
This backbone matched all the taxonomic names (without nomenclatural authors) from all datasets in sPlot 2.1 and TRY v3.0 (@https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14904) to their resolved version based on the Taxonomic Name Resolution Service web application (TNRS version 4.0; @doi:10.1186/1471-2105-14-16; iPlant Collaborative, 2015). 
This allowed us to (1) harmonize all datasets to a common nomenclature, and (2) link the sPlot database to the TRY database (@https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14904). 
The final backone only retained matched taxonomic names at the rank of species or higher. 
Additional detail on the taxonomic resolution is reported in Bruelheide et al. (2019) \[@doi:10.1111/jvs.12710\], while a description of the workflow, including R‐code, is available in Purschke (2017) \[@doi:10.5281/zenodo.845445\].

## Usage Notes
The sPlotOpen database can be downloaded from https://www.idiv.de (link to PlantHub). 
Users are urged to cite the original sources when using sPlotOpen in addition to the present paper, particularly when using data contained in BioTIME (@https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12729). 
For two datasets (AF-00-009, AF-CD-001), the identification of taxa at species level is still in progress. 
As most of the constitutive datasets remain under continuous development, sPlotOpen users are encouraged to get in touch with the custodian(s) of the data they are planning to use (custodian names are reported in https://www.idiv.de/sPlot). 

The data included in the present paper represent the subset of sPlot for which we were able to secure permission for making these data open. 
The additional data in sPlot are available under sPlot's Governance and Data Property Rules (www.idiv.de/sPlot). Using the full sPlot dataset is also recommended if a stratification is desired that is different from the environmental factors used here, for example by geographical region or plot size.

## Code Availability
