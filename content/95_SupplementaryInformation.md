![Global principal component analysis (PCA) of the world environmental conditions. The PCA is based on the matrix of all terrestrial grid cells (n = 8,384,404, spatial grain = 2.5 arcmin) by 30 environmental variables. The PCA space  represents the full environmental space of all terrestrial habitats on Earth, irrespective of whether a grid cell hosted vegetation plots from the sPlotOpen or not. The PCA space is divided into a 10,000 regular tiles (100 x 100), and the number of 2.5 arcmin terrestrial grid cells counted for each tile. Abbreviations - Climate - Bio1 = Annual Mean Temperature, Bio2 = Mean Diurnal Range, Bio3 = Isothermality, Bio4 = Temperature Seasonality, Bio5 = Max Temperature of Warmest Month, Bio6 = Min Temperature of Coldest Month, Bio7 = Temperature Annual Range, Bio8 = Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Bio9 = Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter, Bio10 = Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter, Bio11 = Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter, Bio12 = Annual Precipitation, Bio13 = Precipitation of Wettest Month, Bio14 = Precipitation of Driest Month, Bio15 = Precipitation Seasonality, Bio16 = Precipitation of Wettest Quarter, Bio17 = Precipitation of Driest Quarter, Bio18 = Precipitation of Warmest Quarter, Bio19 = Precipitation of Coldest Quarter. Soil - CECSOL = Cation Exchange capacity of soil, ORCDRC = Soil Organic Carbon Content, PHIHOX = Soil pH, BLDFIE = Bulk Density, CLYPPT = Clay mass fraction, SLTPPT = Silt mass fraction, SNDPPT = Sand mass fraction, CRFVOL = Coarse fragments.](images/figureS1.png){#fig:supplement tag="S1"}
