## Technical Validation {.page_break_before}

The sPlot database has a nested structure and is composed of several individual datasets, each validated and maintained by its respective dataset custodian. 
In some cases, individual datasets are also collections whose vegetation plots were provided by their respective owners (the person who performed the actual vegetation survey) or by someone who digitized the original data from the scientific or grey literature. 
We obviously have no direct control over the individual vegetation plots that we provide here in an open-access dataset. 
Yet, each of these vegetation plots stem from trained professional botanists, or published scientific work, and are accompanied by detailed information on the sampling protocols used, thus ensuring data quality and reliability.  

Before having been integrated into the sPlot database, each dataset was further checked for consistency and, if having a different format, was converted to a Turboveg 2 database (@doi:10.2307/3237010). 
During this conversion, we checked that all datasets contained the required metadata information, and cross-checked that each plot was located within the geographic scopes of its respective dataset. 
Finally, we harmonized all the taxonomic names from all datasets, based on the sPlot’s taxonomic backbone (@doi:10.5281/zenodo.845445). 
This backbone matched all the taxonomic names (without nomenclatural authors) from all datasets in sPlot 2.1 and TRY v3.0 (@https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14904) to their resolved version based on the Taxonomic Name Resolution Service web application (TNRS version 4.0; @doi:10.1186/1471-2105-14-16; iPlant Collaborative, 2015). 
This allowed to (1) harmonize all datasets to a common nomenclature, and (2) link the sPlot database to the TRY database (@https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14904). 
All taxa originally denoted at taxonomic ranks lower than species were aggregated at species level. 
Additional detail on the taxonomic resolution is reported in Bruelheide et al. (2019) \[@doi:10.1111/jvs.12710\], while a description of the workflow, including R‐code, is available in Purschke (2017) \[@doi:10.5281/zenodo.845445\].

## Usage Notes
The sPlot Open database can be downloaded from https://www.idiv.de (link to PlantHub). Users are invited to cite the original sources when using sPlot Open. 
For some datasets (e.g., AF-00-009, AF-CD-001), the identification of taxa at species level is still in progress. 
As a rule, we recommend sPlot Open users to get in touch with the custodian(s) of the data they are planning to use (custodian names are reported in https://www.idiv.de/sPlot). 
The use of data contained in BioTIME (@https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12729) should cite original data citations in addition to the present paper. 
The data included in the present paper represent the subset of sPlot for which we were able to secure permission for making these data open. 
The additional data in sPlot are available under sPlot's Governance and Data Property Rules (www.idiv.de/sPlot).

## Code Availability
